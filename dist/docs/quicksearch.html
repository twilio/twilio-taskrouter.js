With this library, you can manage your Workers in the browser or view the state of your Workspace. This version of TaskRouter SDK can be used with Twilio Flex and TaskRouter standalone instances. Installation NPM npm install twilio-taskrouter Usage The following is a simple example showing a Worker waiting for Reservations. For more information, refer to the API Docs. const TaskRouter = require(\"twilio-taskrouter\"); const Twilio = require(\"twilio\"); const AccessToken = Twilio.jwt.AccessToken; const TaskRouterGrant = AccessToken.TaskRouterGrant; const accountSid = \"\"; const signingKeySid = \"\"; const signingKeySecret = \"\"; const workspaceSid = \"\"; const workerSid = \"\"; const token = createAccessToken( accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret, workspaceSid, workerSid ); const alice = new TaskRouter.Worker(token); alice.on(\"ready\", (readyAlice) =&gt; { console.log(`Worker ${readyAlice.sid} is now ready for work`); }); alice.on(\"reservationCreated\", (reservation) =&gt; { console.log( `Reservation ${reservation.sid} has been created for ${alice.sid}` ); console.log(`Task attributes are: ${reservation.task.attributes}`); reservation.on(\"accepted\", (acceptedReservation) =&gt; { console.log(`Reservation ${acceptedReservation.sid} was accepted.`); }); reservation .accept() .then((acceptedReservation) =&gt; { console.log(`Reservation status is ${acceptedReservation.status}`); }) .catch((err) =&gt; { console.log(`Error: ${err}`); }); }); function createAccessToken( accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret, workspaceSid, workerSid ) { const taskRouterGrant = new TaskRouterGrant({ workerSid: workerSid, workspaceSid: workspaceSid, role: \"worker\", }); const accessToken = new AccessToken( accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret ); accessToken.addGrant(taskRouterGrant); accessToken.identity = \"alice\"; return accessToken.toJwt(); } Changelog See CHANGELOG.md. License See LICENSE.md. Building Fork and clone the repository. Use npm to install node 8 (other versions may run into problems). Then, install dependencies with: yarn install Then run the build script: yarn build The builds and docs will be placed in the dist/ directory. Before commits, be sure to validate by running: make lint Testing Create a twilio account copy ./test/integration_test_setup/.env.example to ./test/integration_test_setup/.env set ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN, SIGNING_KEY_SID, SIGNING_KEY_SECRET Run ./test/integration_test_setup/RunIntegrationTestLocal.sh this will create everything needed for running E2E tests and run the tests Test with Sample App See README.md Contributing Bug fixes welcome!
