With this library, you can manage your Workers in the browser or view the state of your Workspace. Note that this is a preview release. You may encounter bugs and instability, and the APIs available in this release may change in subsequent releases. We want your feedback! Email Ben Getson Product Manager for TaskRouter at bgetson@twilio.com with suggested improvements, feature requests and general feedback. If you need technical support, contact help@twilio.com. InstallationNPMnpm install twilio-taskrouterUsageThe following is a simple example showing a Worker waiting for Reservations. For more information, refer to the API Docs. const TaskRouter = require('twilio-taskrouter'); const Twilio = require('twilio'); const AccessToken = Twilio.jwt.AccessToken; const TaskRouterGrant = AccessToken.TaskRouterGrant; const accountSid = ''; const signingKeySid = ''; const signingKeySecret = ''; const workspaceSid = ''; const workerSid = ''; const token = createAccessToken(accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret, workspaceSid, workerSid); const alice = new TaskRouter.Worker(token); alice.on('ready', readyAlice =&gt; { console.log(`Worker ${readyAlice.sid} is now ready for work`); }); alice.on('reservationCreated', reservation =&gt; { console.log(`Reservation ${reservation.sid} has been created for ${alice.sid}`); console.log(`Task attributes are: ${reservation.task.attributes}`); reservation.on('accepted', acceptedReservation =&gt; { console.log(`Reservation ${acceptedReservation.sid} was accepted.`); }); reservation.accept().then(acceptedReservation =&gt; { console.log(`Reservation status is ${acceptedReservation.status}`); }).catch((err) =&gt; { console.log(`Error: ${err}`); }); }); function createAccessToken(accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret, workspaceSid, workerSid) { const taskRouterGrant = new TaskRouterGrant({ workerSid: workerSid, workspaceSid: workspaceSid, role: 'worker' }); const accessToken = new AccessToken(accountSid, signingKeySid, signingKeySecret); accessToken.addGrant(taskRouterGrant); accessToken.identity = 'alice'; return accessToken.toJwt(); } ChangelogSee CHANGELOG.md.
